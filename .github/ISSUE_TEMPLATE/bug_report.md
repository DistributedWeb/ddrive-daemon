**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior.

**Expected Behavior**
What did you expect to happen?

** OS **

** Node version **

** Was the daemon installed from NPM or bundled with Beaker? **

Add any other context about the problem here.

__Important Note__: Daemon errors are likely to be found in `~/.hyperdrive/log.json` or `~/.hyperdrive/output.log` (the latter is for unexpected, non-JSON output). These files might contain sensitive drive keys, so don't upload the whole thing -- just extract any stack traces or odd error messages!
